\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Client Identification} 
My client is my ICT teacher at Long Road
sixth form college called Tom.

\section{Investigation}
Tom requires an electronic equivalent of a
markbook, Tom teaches GCSE, diploma and A level ICT. Therefore he requires the
markbook to take in A-E grades for A level ICT and pass/merit/destinction/fail for GCSE and diploma ICT. The markbook needs to take
in attendance and marks for units. The program must be flexible to create an
infinite amount of units and must have an option of deleting units. Units should
contain assignments, number of assignments within the unit should also have a
possibilty of adding additional assignments without limitation. The program should have the database seperately from the main program, 
so that the databese could be backed up incase of hardware failures.
